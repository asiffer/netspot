title: Intrusion Detection System
---

If you are interested in network intrusion detection, you probably know
that current defenses rely on rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS)
like [Snort](https://www.snort.org/), [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) or [Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/).
They work very fine once you have the right rules but writing these rules is only possible when attacks are accurately known.
That's where **anomaly-based IDS** come in! `netspot`Â is such an IDS.

Many previous works have proposed such solutions but `netspot` is different
because of its simplicity and above all its lack of ambition.
Keep in mind that `netspot` won't flag all zero-day attacks, but it will
find relevant anomalies on your network.
